## üë§ About me:
Hi, I'm 18 and started software engineering roughly 3 years ago. Currently, I'm working for the German tech company CHECK24 on the Android Team. What I planned to do after school (yeah, I'm still in school for 6 weeks ‚òπÔ∏è) is to apply for business informatics at the Technical University in Munich and also to start a startup I'm also currently working on with two folks from CHECK24. You can also check out my social media links I added below or just enjoy the funny meme that shows up below üòÇ <br/>
